### when time loses meaning



and when every last week feels like months ago.\
that when you love it.\
living that is.\
and its like immortality. \
except its not a curse this time.

add that to being on your own,\
independent of soul crushing expectations from yourself\
independent of poisoned chains of infected souls\
independent of any lethal deluding chemicals

that sensation of a warm blessing\
every rays that hit your face\
from that rising sun\
and when suddenly\
you can hear everything around you\
screaming for attention\
demanding to be seen, explored, admired, felt\
all those abstract complex patterns you've been ignorant\
to smallest, simplest, childish stuffs, fostering joy\
and it all\
just feels right



literally heaven!\
oh how i wish you could experience it
