### when time loses meaning



and when every last week feels like months ago.\
that when you love it.\
living that is.\
and its like immortality. \
except its not a curse this time.

add that to being on your own,\
independent of any lethal addictive chemical \
or any infected soul\
or any pending expectations from yourself

literally heaven!\
and i wish you could experience it
